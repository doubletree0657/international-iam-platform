# international-iam-platform

`international-iam-platform` is a backend-focused identity and access
management platform project built with Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Security,
Spring Authorization Server, PostgreSQL, Docker, and CI/CD practice.

The project exists as a portfolio-grade engineering workspace for modern Java
backend development, identity security, OAuth2, MFA, SCIM-style provisioning,
containerized local development, continuous delivery practice, and technical
interview preparation for international backend roles.

It is under active development and is not production-ready. The current code is
useful for demonstrating implementation direction, design judgment, testing
practice, and incremental delivery, but it should not be treated as a complete
IAM product or deployed for real users.

## Technical Focus

The project targets these areas:

- Java 21 and Spring Boot backend architecture.
- Identity domain modeling for tenants, users, clients, roles, permissions,
  groups, and audit events.
- OAuth2 and authorization server behavior with Spring Authorization Server.
- Spring Security integration, JWTs, JWKs, and scope-based API protection.
- MFA workflows and secure handling of authentication secrets.
- SCIM-style user and group provisioning APIs.
- PostgreSQL persistence with Flyway migrations and JPA.
- Docker-based local services and CI/CD workflows.
- Testcontainers-backed integration testing.
- Clear documentation for code review and interview discussion.

## Current State

The codebase currently includes a Spring Boot backend with Flyway-managed
PostgreSQL schema migrations, JPA repositories, service-layer orchestration,
REST controllers, DTO validation, centralized error handling, OpenAPI output,
JWT/JWK support, scope-protected APIs, audit logging, TOTP enrollment and
verification, encrypted MFA secret storage, SCIM-style user and group APIs, a
Dockerfile, local PostgreSQL/Redis Compose services, and a GitLab CI pipeline.

Login support currently uses Spring Security's default server-side form login as
an early integration step for browser-based authorization work. It is not a
product-grade login experience, does not include a frontend, and does not by
itself grant access to management or SCIM APIs. Those APIs remain protected by
OAuth2 JWT scope checks.

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.5
- Spring Security and Spring Authorization Server
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Flyway
- Testcontainers
- Maven Wrapper
- Docker Compose
- OpenAPI / Swagger UI
- GitLab CI/CD

## Running Tests

Tests use Maven and Testcontainers. Docker or a compatible container runtime
must be available.

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## Local Development

Required tools:

- JDK 21
- Docker or a Docker-compatible runtime
- Git

Start local dependencies:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run the application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

Stop local dependencies:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Local services:

- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`
- Redis: `localhost:6379`

The Docker Compose credentials are local development values only.

## API Documentation

After the application starts:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

The health endpoint is public. Management APIs under `/api/**` and SCIM APIs
under `/scim/v2/**` require OAuth2 JWT scopes:

- Read operations require `iam.read`.
- Write operations require `iam.write`.

## Roadmap

Planning is tracked in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md). The roadmap is the
single planning document for current direction, future product tracks, and
documentation policy.
